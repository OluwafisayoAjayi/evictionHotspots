Description: 
    Tools for identifying and visualizing spatial eviction hotspots using 
    global and local spatial autocorrelation methods. The package computes 
    Global Moran’s I and Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) on 
    eviction-related variables within sf objects, constructs spatial 
    weights using k-nearest neighbors, and classifies statistically 
    significant local clusters. Visualization functions support both 
    static maps using tmap and interactive maps using leaflet.
